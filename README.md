# Graph-Analytics

Graph theory has been around for quite some time and we are seeing majority of the optimization problems now a days use graph theory as a base - dijkstra's algorithm etc.

And this is now slowing moving into the analytics space as well. Many inddustries are starting to utilize graph theory for a variety of analytics problems.

We concetrated on one area where we saw a huge potential - Organizational Network Analysis(or as people like to call it - HR Analytics).

We wanted to understand the inherent relationships within a company and how to construct as network of employees which can ebe used for a variety of sources like - Identifying the most influencing person, identifying the most effective team, identifying the weakest links between the clients and the internal teams etc.

Since company data is very confidential and is very difficult to get hold of we used the data that is on par with employee details - our MSBA program whatsapp group chat.

We were able to establish the relationships between members by defining a condition of reply to a message.
